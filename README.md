# Paina Cafe Mobile App
This project was to create an app for the company, Paina Cafe. This was done in order to learn more about how apps and websites can be related to each and give me more experience creating user interfaces based on a web design.

This project includes a way to select which of the 3 locations you want. It displays an outdated menu, a google map api rendering each location, a nonfunctioning login and profile page made with a customer MongoDB and local server, and a home page based off of the home website page, including links to social media.

I used Kotlin to make the android app on Android Studio. While the project is incomplete, I will be coming back to it after I finish my schooling.
